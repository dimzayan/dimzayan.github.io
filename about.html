<p>Dim Zayan is a multidisciplinary artist and designer that caught the Bitcoin bug and never recovered. It started with a simple itch to learn about financial freedom and stack sats, but quickly spiraled into more serious symptoms, such as obsessive hodling, meme making, and feverish orange pill preaching.</p>

<p>Dim believes in an expressionist renaissance as a complement to the sovereign individual. Through his work, he explores his own existentialism and seeks to expose a new layer of sensibility over subjects deemed be otherwise emotionless such as finance or technology. He is also the author of Bulltardia, a Bitcoin comic following the adventures of Bit the honey badger on his way to the moon.</p>

<p>Dim cultivates eclecticism as a philosophy and draws his inspiration from many eras, styles and disciplines. He admires masters like Kooning, Carravagio, Otomo, Moebius, Hergé, Ditko, Rembrant, La Tour, Crumb, mcFarlane, el Greco, Dali, Appel, Cézanne, Doig, ancient Egypt and most of the delta Blues musicians.</p>
<p>When he is not making art, Dim shares artistic stories and thoughts about Bitcoin, freedom, permaculture, music, the esoteric, politics and spirituality. After living several decades in capital cities, Dim found peace living off-the-grid in the companionship of his wife and wonderful dog, Bowie.</p>
